  *Long ago, two races ruled over Earth: HUMANS and MONSTERS.<br>
  *One day, war broke out between the two races.<br>
  *After a long battle, the humans were victorious.<br>
  *They sealed the monsters underground with a magic spell.<br>
</p>
<br>
  <p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:100px;font-size:17px;">That is the backround information that you are given at the start of the game.
    The monsters have been living underground eversince.
    They live under a mountain called Mount Ebott, which is known on the surface as a dangerous place.
    Humans think so because every child to go there disappears and is nowhere to be found.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the story the player controls such a child, that has unknowingly fallen into a pit which brought them to the underground, under Mount Ebott.
    The player meets the first character, Flowey the Flower.
    At first sight, it's a happy flower with no evil intentions.
    But then everything takes a left turn, and as Flowey tries to hurt the player, Toriel comes rescue them.
    They discover that there are two ways to play this game. The Pacifist Route and the Genocide Route.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2 style="margin-left:250px;">Pacifist Route</h2>
  <br>
  <p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:100px;font-size:17px;"> As the name implies, this route in the game is centered about being nice, making friends and hurting no one.
    At the start of this run the player notices that their guide for the tutorial, Toriel, wants to protect you by keeping you at her home.
    The player, as any child would do, proceeds to ask Toriel multiple times how they could get home.
    Toriel, not wanting to lose another child to Asgore, tries to protect the child and locking the door to the rest of the underground, so that the cild would have to live in the ruins.
    The child follows her, and toriel challenges the child to a fight to see if they would survive outside of the ruins.

    <br>
    <p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:100px;font-size:17px;">
    This is where the player officially starts the Pacifist Route.
    In battle, the player has made the decision not to fight.
    Toriel is puzzled by this, since she counted on the child being violent.
    Toriel starts missing attacks on purpose, and she then tells you that if you do leave, that you shouldn't come back.
    She walks away, looks back and leaves.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:100px;font-size:17px;">
    As the player walks into the ruins, they are greeted with an eerie silence.
    In that silent snowy forest the player meets two new friends: sans and Papyrus, the skelebros.
    As Papyrus tries to "capture" the child, they form a bond which prevents Papyrus to capture said child.
    Sans just stands around, telling the player how cool his brother is.
